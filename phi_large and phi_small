c This Fortran90 code calculates phi_small and phi_large, the bearings of the points where the tilited elipses intersect the elipse-vortex boundary.
c Note it is not where the tilted elipses cross, that probably does not require calculating.

c parameters

    real phi_small, phi_large
    real 9750 radius of boundary 
    height of where ellipse intercets boundary = 9770*sqrt(1-(16/1894))
    
c constants
