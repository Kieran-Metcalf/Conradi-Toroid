c Find the height of the control point P2
c method
c 1. Equation of ellipse, translate 
c 2. Differentiate find gradient at 9750mm
c 3. Use equation of straight line, m=gradient at point P3

c Pim's toroid is such that it's cross section, 2d radial slice is elliptical up to point +-P3, this is an observation and a constraint.
c The center of the ellipse lays on the equatorial plane, and for this calculation is tanslated radially outward, in the r direction 
c by a distance equal to the major radius, a=10750mm=r_translate
    REAL :: r, z, r_translate

c major axis dimension = 21500mm/2  =  10750mm		from the photograph of the toroid
c height of toroid from photograph 9770mm

    ((r-10750)^2)/10750^2) + z^2/9770^2 = 1

c rearrange for z and take positive result, thus considering the imaginary line above the equatorial plane, when rotated this forms the constraining toroidal plane containing the tilted
c ellipses, but this script is concerned only with calculating the 2D gradient so that the equation for the vortex of the toroid can be found. This equation, again 
c describes a plane which contains the inner helix of Pim's toroid art piece. 

    z^2/9770^2 = 1 - ((r-10750)^2)/10750^2)
    z^2 = (1 - ((r-10750)^2)/10750^2))*9770^2
    z(r) = SQRT((1 - ((r-10750)^2)/10750^2))*9770^2)   c positive result only. 
    (z(r=9750)
    PRINT*,(z(r=9750)
    
c r=9750mm is an empirical measurment and is where the toroid is no longer elliptical and the inside vortex begins. Now differentiate z(r) wrt r at this point and
c this will give poth the 2D coordinates and the 2D gradient to match at the boundary clinder.
