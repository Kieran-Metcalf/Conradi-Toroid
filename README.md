# Conradi-Toroid
An attempt to describe Pim Conradi's orbodesic toroid architecture structure. 
It can be done using a CAD package, and was done https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/warehouse/v1.0/publiccontent/a5f1dd3a-8c16-432a-b31a-1d6feb326f8f, the beautiful inside spirals are missing, because I was not satisfied using polygons, or straight sections by hand to match the known gradients and points. I know that it can be described with the helix function nestled with a parmectric function, after a frustrating foray with Bezier functions I gave up. 

As a failed frustrated phycicist, I looked towards CERN atom smasher and how they describe particle trajectories, and was surprised to find that they use Fortran! Everyone says that you must declare variables in Fortran so it is too much trouble. But the essence of declareing variables is essential to know the CPU, whether quantum or, register-controller-operator architecture. 

So the task in the spirit of true computer science is to describe Pim Conradi's toroid in less than 100 lines of Fortran 90 code, the circular array of 12 pairs of translated and rotated elipces should be achieveable. And the point gradient matched inner helical spirals not to difficult. (cough cough LOL, really?)

A helix is best described with a parametric equation in cylindrical polar coordinates, that is with 

Of course there is no 'buisness case' for this, so ...

Finding coordinates of end points at the boundary is trivial trigganometry, finding the starting parameters of the helix to match the gradients may be impossible as only the waist is controlled, unless maybe it's shape is describes by a multi order polynomial.
