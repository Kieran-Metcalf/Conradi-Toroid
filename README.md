# Conradi-Toroid
An attempt to describe Pim Conradi's geodesics on a toroid (which may be called orbodesics) toroid architecture structure. 
CAD models https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/warehouse/v1.0/publiccontent/a5f1dd3a-8c16-432a-b31a-1d6feb326f8f, the beautiful inside spirals are missing, 
To improve on polygons, or straight sections by hand to match the known gradients and points, it may be described with the helix function nestled with a parmectric function, or with point-grad-pont-grad Bezier curves. Least lines of code would be the former. 

CERN atom smasher and how they describe particle trajectories, FORTRAN still a lower level language. 

Describe Pim Conradi's toroid in the most eligant way possible and not relying on AutoDesk, Fortran 90 code, the circular array of 12 pairs of translated and rotated elipces should be achieveable. And the gradients matched at each pont of interection with the inner helical spirals. In computer graphics images can be vector images or rasta images, what are the two equivant file types for 3D models, I want to describe Pim Conradi's strutures as vector models. 

A helix is best described with a parametric equation in cylindrical polar coordinates, that is with 

Of course there is no buisness case for this, motivation is personal development and pedagogical. 

Finding coordinates of end points at the boundary is trivial trigganometry, finding the starting parameters of the helix to match the gradients may be impossible as only the waist is controlled, unless maybe it's shape is describes by a multi order polynomial.
