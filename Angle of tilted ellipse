PROGRAM CoordinatesOfJoinsInTheConradiToroid
IMPLICIT  NONE

c input parameters
    real :: r_clindcoords_inside_edge, r_clindcoords_boundary, angle_between_ellipses, toroid_height, toroid_radius, 
    integer  :: pairs_ellipses
c the following angle parameter is defined as the angle the planes of the tilted ellipses make with eachother on the equatorial plane, it could have been 
c with the equatorial plane itself, but I decided on this because it is an actual measurment that can be made on Pim's artwork


c Output parameters, or parameter which are intrinsic to the shape and number of ribs forming Pim's toroid. 
    real :: r_clindcoords_intersections
    

c equation of tilted ellipse leads to this formula, see hand written pdf.

    z_ellipse(r_ellipse)=SQRT((1 - r_ellipse^2/(0.5*toroid_radius)^2)*(toroid_height/COS(0.5*ellipses_angle)^2)
    
c solved at r = r_clindcoords_intersections
c coordinates of tilted ellipse at boundary Finding coordinates of end points at the boundary is trivial as, by direct measurment 

c Create phi_large and phi_small

 c  calculate phi_small and phi_large, the angle in the xy plane from x of the points where the tilited elipses intersect the elipse-vortex boundary.
c Note it is not where the tilted elipses cross, that probably does not require calculating.

c parameters
   

   REAL  :: a, b, c
   REAL  :: d
   REAL  :: root1, root2
    real phi_small, phi_large
    r_clindcoords_boundary
    height of where ellipse intercepts boundary = (-b+SQRT(b^2-4ac))/2a  ! quadratic
        a = 1/(tan(0.5*angle_between_ellipses)
        b = -((0.5*toroid_radius)^2)*COS(0.5*angle_between_ellipses)  /   toroid_height*SIN(0.5*angle_between_ellipses)   ! equate ellipse triangle with triangle in plane see pdf
        c = (0.5*toroid_radius)^2 - r_clindcoords_boundary^2

!   Solve  Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0 given B*B-4*A*C >= 0
!   Now, we are able to detect complex roots.
