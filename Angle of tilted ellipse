c Fortran90


c input parameters
    real :: r_clindcoords_inside_edge, r_clindcoords_boundary, angle_between_ellipses, toroid_height, toroid_radius, 
    integer  pairs_ellipses
c the following angle parameter is defined as the angle the planes of the tilted ellipses make with eachother on the equatorial plane, it could have been 
c with the equatorial plane itself, but I decided on this because it is an actual measurment that can be made on Pim's artwork


c Output parameters, or parameter which are intrinsic to the shape and number of ribs forming Pim's toroid. 
    real :: r_clindcoords_intersections
    

c equation of tilted ellipse leads to this formula, see hand written pdf.

    z'(r)=SQRT((1 - r^2/(0.5*toroid_radius)^2)*(toroid_height/COS(0.5*ellipses_angle)^2)
    
c solved at r = r_clindcoords_intersections
c coordinates of tilted ellipse at boundary Finding coordinates of end points at the boundary is trivial as, by direct measurment 

c Create phi_large and phi_small
