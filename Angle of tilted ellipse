c Fortran90
c input parameters
    real :: r_clindcoords_inside_edge, r_clindcoords_boundary, r_clindcoords_intersections, toroid_height, toroid_radius
c the following angle parameter is defined as the angle the planes of the tilted ellipses make with eachother on the equatorial plane, it could have been 
c with the equatorial plane itself, but I decided on this because it is an actual measurment that can be made on Pim's artwork
    real :: angle_between_ellipses
    
c equation of ellipse leads to this formula, see hand written pdf.
