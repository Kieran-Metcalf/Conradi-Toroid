c This work in progress program calculates the z and r coordinates of the radial spline control points in the radial plane. 
c This program is written in Fortran90

c Input parameters,
    Integer Radial distance from z axis to boundary between the ellipse and the inside vortex
    Integer Height of the toroid. 
    Integer radius of whole toroid

c Decleration of variables
    Real z,r

c Output Parameters
c   Height of point at boundary
c   Radial gradient of point at boundary. 
c   Height of control point P2

    print *, enter Integer Radial distance from z axis to boundary between the ellipse and the inside vortex Integer Height of the toroid. Integer radius of whole toroid
    read *, toroid_radius, distance_to_boundary, height_of_toroid

c equation of ellipse to rotate about the z axis to form the extremity of Pimâ€™s toroid. 
c    z(r) = + SQRT(  (1 - ((r-(R/2))/(R/2))^2   )  )*H
c  first derrivitave https://www.wolframalpha.com/ dz/dr = (H (R - 2 r))/(R sqrt(r (R - r)))
    gradient = (H (R - 2 r))/(R sqrt(r (R - r)))
c    Find the height of the ellipse at this boundary, i.e. the 2D coordinates of P3
    HeightAtBoundary = + SQRT(  (1 - ((boundary-(R/2))/(R/2))^2   )  )*H
c eqn of straight line to find point P2, y=mx+c
c    z = gradient * r + P3z
    P3z = gradient * r_boundary + P2z
c P2r=0
